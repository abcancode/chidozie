## 🚀 My Goals
My journey through AltSchool Africa has been wonderful. As a Frontend Engineering student, I have grown from writing basic HTML pages to building complete, interactive web applications with modern tools like React and React Query. Along the way, I've developed not just technical skills, but also soft skills like collaboration, version control with Git, and writing cleaner, more maintainable code.
